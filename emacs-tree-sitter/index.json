The symbol specifies the type of node to match, while the remaining elements describe what the inner structure of a matched node (i.e. its child nodes) should look like.\n;; Match any function call.

When used for syntax highlighting, capture names are then mapped to display faces, which determine the appearance of the corresponding nodes.\n;; Match function calls.

For example, function definitions are highlighted with tree-sitter-hl-face:function, while function calls are highlighted with tree-sitter-hl-face:function.call. However, for compatibility with existing themes, the default values for most of these faces inherit from built-in font-lock faces.\nIf you want to leverage the full power of Tree-sitter\u0026rsquo;s syntax highlighting approach, you should customize these faces.\nFace Mappings By default, when the highlighting query associates a node with CAPTURE-NAME, it will be highlighted with the face tree-sitter-hl-face:CAPTURE-NAME.

It stores the state that is needed to iteratively search for matches. ts-query-captures query node text-function [query-cursor]  ts-query-matches query node text-function [query-cursor] Execute a query on the given syntax node. ts-query-captures returns a sequence of captures, sorted in the order they appear in the source code. ts-query-matches returns a sequence of matches, sorted in the order they were found. Each capture has the form (capture-tag . captured-node), where capture-tag is a symbol, whose name is the corresponding capture name defined in query (without the prefix @). If query was created with a custom tag assigner, capture-tag is instead the value returned by that function.\nEach match has the form (pattern-index . match-captures), where pattern-index is the 0-based position of the matched pattern within query, and match-captures is a sequence of captures associated with the match.\nSince the syntax tree doesn\u0026rsquo;t store the source code\u0026rsquo;s text, text-function is called to get nodes\u0026rsquo; texts (for text-based predicates). It should take 2 parameters: (beg-byte end-byte), and return the corresponding chunk of text in the source code. Usually this should be #'ts--buffer-substring-no-properties.\nFor performance reason, query-cursor should typically be created once, and reused between query executions. It should be omitted only for one-off experimentation.\n  "
